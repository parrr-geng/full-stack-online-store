<p> 
  Interested in the complex product journey of eCommerce website users, I challenged myself to build a fullstack online store 
  during my Bootcamp using JavaScript, NodeJS, MongoDB, HTML5 and CSS (Tailwind). 
  Through this project, I achieved a much deeper understanding of complex client-facing website structures and 
  constant user experience optimisation. Within the agile team, I strove for clean code and clear communication, especially when we encountered merge conflicts.
